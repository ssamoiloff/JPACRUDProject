# JPACRUDProject

### Overview
This web application utilizes a database to serve up stats on the current 2020 MotoGP riders. The site lets the user view, create, edit, and delete riders from the database.

### Technologies Used
- Java SE8
- MySQL/MySQL Workbench
- JPQL
- Spring Boot MVC
- Spring Tool Suite IDE
- ZSH Shell
- GitHub/Git

### Lessons Learned
* In this project, I gained a much better understanding of the way Spring Boot uses annotations to automatically configure mappings and other common tasks.

* One of the more surprising lessons was how simple I/O to/from a MySQL database is when using JPQL with Spring Boot. The amount of time saved is substantial.

* Front end design is surprisingly complicated and requires a totally different skillset that I never knew I lacked. This is something I plan on spending more time on in the future.
